# Protein Sequence alignment using NW algorithm
The code takes input 2 sequences and aligns them with each other, such that their similarity score is maximum using the **Needleman-Wunsch algorithm**. 

**Note :** The implementation corresponds to **gap penalty = 0** and the scoring scheme as identity scoring scheme.


To use the script:

```
python alignment_script.py -i <input_file>
```

The above algorithm was part of an assignment for the course **Introduction to Quantitative Biology** offered to undergraduate students at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD).
