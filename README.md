# Quantitative-Biology-Portfolio

The projects are part of the course Introduction to Quantitative Biology, offered to 4th semester undergraduates at IIITD.

- ### [Protein Seqeunce Alignment Using Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm](https://github.com/adityasaini70/Quantitative-Biology-Portfolio/tree/master/Protein%20Sequence%20alignment%20using%20NW%20algorithm) 
  The code takes input 2 sequences and aligns them with each other, such that their similarity score is maximum using the **Needleman-Wunsch algorithm**. 

  **Note :** The implementation corresponds to **gap penalty = 0** and the scoring scheme as identity scoring scheme.


  To use the script:

  ```
  python alignment_script.py -i <input_file>
  ```
